# IMI_Chemical_Cue_Detection
Analysis for a laboratory experiment conducted in 2020 in which Painted Turtles and False Map Turtles were exposed to varying concentrations of imidacloprid. Turtles participated in four trials where they were presented with a chemical food cue and plain water. Turtle behavior was recorded and analyzed for differences in overall activity and foraging behaviors.
